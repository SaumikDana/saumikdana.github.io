        With crystal clarity, I went about the task of gnashing at the EB1-A green card the moment
        I started my tenure at USC. My communication with the advisor was spot-on, and I delivered 
        on the starting premise a lot earlier than anticipated. I got involved in a 3-month NSF grant
        writing process, by bringing in a professor from Columbia University on board, and albeit the
        endeavor fizzled out, it got me a lot of good grace from the advisor at USC. I kept pounding 
        at the EB1-A requirements, and got my I-140 approved a few days after the dawn of the new year of 
        2022. As the months rolled by, I started looking for industry opportunities in earnest, and I 
        realized that the startup framework would be optimal to roll up my sleeves, and pick up skills
        that are super critical for growth in the industry. I got my green card on late July 2022, and I started
        started working at a fusion startup, on a stock price prediction tool. I took a 4 month career break 
        after working for 8 months, and finally got the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of the freedom
        that a permanent residency provides. Post that, I joined a surgical navigation startup working on
        medical image processing algorithms. The startup has taken the atypical agile approach of
        cobbling product demos on a regular basis, and I have understood the fine balance between development
        and agility is a hard act.
