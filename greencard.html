    As I gradually started to realize that I shall be pursuing an industry career
    for a longer term, I published a paper, and moved on to an opportunity to work on
    an Army funded project at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in upstate NY. A funding issue 
    notwithstanding, I did get an interesting opportunity to work on a consulting project with 
    a startup in NYC during my time at RPI. Around that time, I also realized the impediment 
    of the visa process, which disallowed me from joining a company although we had excellent
    agreement of mutual value we bring to the table. I started taking steps to address the fact 
    that I would have to pursue my green card seriously, and I moved on to a bioinformatics
    gig at Baylor College of Medicine, with the sole purpose of publishing a paper with a 
    ton of citations. A month after starting at BCM, the United States shutdown in response 
    to the pandemic, and that hit me hard as I lost the opportunity to work with the colleagues
    at BCM on-site. A difficult period followed, and I was left with a simple choice of being
    very careful of the next position I choose, as this shall be the final one before I get 
    my green card. Such opportunity presented itself in the form of a postdoc at University of
    Southern California, and I primary job right off the gate was to add to the code framework
    the same algorithm that had presented itself with so much success during my PhD. 
    With crystal clarity, I went about the task of gnashing at the EB1-A green card the moment
    I started my tenure at USC. My communication with the advisor was spot-on, and I delivered 
    on the starting premise a lot earlier than anticipated. I got involved in a 3-month NSF grant
    writing process, by bringing in a professor from Columbia University on board, and albeit the
    endeavor fizzled out, it got me a lot of good grace from the advisor at USC. I kept pounding 
    at the EB1-A requirements, and got my I-140 approved a few days after the dawn of the new year of 
    2022. As the months rolled by, I started looking for industry opportunities in earnest, and I 
    realized that the startup framework would be optimal to roll up my sleeves, and pick up skills
    that are super critical for growth in the industry. I got my green card on late July 2022, and I started
    started working at a fusion startup, on a stock price prediction tool. I took a 4 month career break 
    after working for 8 months, and finally got the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of the freedom
    that a permanent residency provides. Post that, I joined a surgical navigation startup working on
    medical image processing algorithms. The startup has taken the atypical agile approach of
    cobbling product demos on a regular basis, and I have understood the fine balance between development
    and agility is a hard act.
