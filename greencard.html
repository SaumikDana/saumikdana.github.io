    As I gradually started to realize during my first postdoc at LANL that 
    I shall be pursuing an industry career for a longer term, I published a paper, 
    and moved on to an opportunity to work on
    an Army funded project at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in upstate NY. A funding issue 
    notwithstanding, I did get an interesting opportunity to work on a consulting project with 
    a startup in NYC during my time at RPI. Around that time, I also realized the impediment 
    of the visa process, which disallowed me from joining a company although we had excellent
    agreement of mutual value we bring to the table. I started taking steps to address the fact 
    that I would have to pursue my green card seriously, and I moved on to a bioinformatics
    gig at Baylor College of Medicine, with the sole purpose of publishing a paper with a 
    ton of citations. A month after starting at BCM, the United States shutdown in response 
    to the pandemic, and that hit me hard as I lost the opportunity to work with the colleagues
    at BCM on-site. A difficult period followed, and I was left with a simple choice of being
    very careful of the next position I choose, as this shall be the final one before I get 
    my green card. Such opportunity presented itself in the form of a postdoc at University of
    Southern California, and my primary job right off the gate was to add to the code framework
    the same algorithm that had presented itself with so much success during my PhD. 
    With crystal clarity, I went about the task of gnashing at the EB1-A green card the moment
    I started my tenure at USC. My communication with the advisor was spot-on, and I delivered 
    on the starting premise a lot earlier than anticipated. I got involved in a 3-month NSF grant
    writing process, by bringing in a professor from Columbia University on board, and albeit the
    endeavor fizzled out, it got me a lot of good grace from the advisor at USC. I kept pounding 
    at the EB1-A requirements, and got my I-140 approved a few days after the dawn of the new year of 
    2022. As the months rolled by, I started looking for industry opportunities in earnest, and I 
    realized that the startup framework would be optimal to roll up my sleeves, and pick up skills
    that are super critical for growth in the industry. I got my green card on late July 2022, and I started
    started working at a fusion startup, on a stock price prediction tool. I took a 4 month career break 
    after working for 8 months, and finally got the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of the freedom
    that a permanent residency provides. Post that, I joined a surgical navigation startup working on
    medical image processing algorithms. The startup has taken the atypical agile approach of
    cobbling product demos on a regular basis, and I have understood the fine balance between development
    and agility is a hard act.
