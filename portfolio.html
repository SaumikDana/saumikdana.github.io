            <h3>Point Cloud Processing with PointNet</h3>
            <p>
                I embarked on an ambitious project to leverage deep learning 
                for point cloud processing. Utilizing the PointNet architecture, 
                I developed a model capable of handling complex spatial data. 
                This project was not only a technical challenge 
                but also a venture into optimizing computational resources 
                for real-time processing. 
                The outcome was a robust model that significantly 
                enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of our point cloud analysis, 
                paving the way for more advanced applications in surgical navigation.

            <h3>Bayesian Inference for Time Series Data</h3>
            <p>
                At USC, I spearheaded a project to develop a 
                Bayesian inference framework for model parameter estimation 
                from time series data. 
                The challenge was to create a model 
                that could accurately predict and analyze complex data patterns. 
                By employing Bayesian methods, I was able to construct a 
                framework that not only provided precise estimations 
                but also accounted for uncertainties in the data.

            <h3>Geoscientific Simulations</h3>
            <p>
                My tenure at UT Austin, Los Alamos National Lab, and USC 
                was marked by extensive work in geoscientific simulations. 
                These projects ranged from modeling subsurface flow to 
                simulating geological formations. 
                Each project presented unique challenges, 
                such as handling large datasets 
                and creating accurate simulation models. 
                My contributions not only advanced the computational aspects 
                of these projects but also provided valuable insights
                into earth sciences, 
                demonstrating the power of computational modeling 
                in understanding and solving complex geoscientific problems.
