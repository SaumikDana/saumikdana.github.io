    <p>
    I started in Fall 2012 at the Department of Engineering Mechanics, 
    on course to a classic Application Engineer working out at places like Abaqus, 
    and Ansys as a career path starting step post PhD. 
    The first problem I solved was a hydraulic fracturing code
    refactoring to stub out a cleaner way to understand how fractures 
    branch out under hydraulic 
    pressure inside the cracks. Along the way, I understood the impact 
    of algorithms and how the 
    underlying mathematics needs to be comprehended to genuinely make progress 
    in terms of making 
    things faster and accurate. In the Fall of 2014, 
    I switched to an advisor at the renowned Institute for Computational
    Engineering, right across the road from the Department of Engineering Mechanics, 
    and started
    tackling problems on the intersection of mechanics, high performance computing, 
    and algorithms. The crux of the PhD thesis was the solution of this problem.

    <p>
    The idea being that the injection or production wells in the reservoir section 
    of the domain causes geomechanical reaction which have implications on the
    free surface, albeit on a different length scale. Prior to the implementation 
    of my algorithm, there was no way in-house for the code framework to pull off
    a simulation of such magnitude.
    With some sustained work in high performance computing, iterative solution techniques, 
    and coding in a mixed programming language environment, I was able to generate
    simulations of free surface displacements along side pressure evolution almost
    10000 feet beneath the free surface, at the same time. The first step was to do the
    hard yards of understanding the mixed language framework with the MPI implementation, 
    and then the iterative sequential solution technique. I arrived at a method that
    allows leveraging the strengths of the code and the technique, and I went about the task
    over a 2 year period lending to the images above. Right after I published my first paper, 
    which was highly succesful, I went about a mathematical analysis to satisfy the wishes
    of my advisor, who is an Applied Mathematician. The big takeway from my PhD was the 
    ability to take apart complicated code frameworks, and dissect a solution technique 
    that is minimally invasive, and yet a novelty. Ever since, this has served me well.

    My natural inclination post PhD was to pursue a postdoc, to experience a national lab
    environment, and I went about working with a team of excellent scientists at LANL 
    on a graph based reduced order model to deliver fast yet accurate estimates of production 
    to rig operators in hydrocarbon projects.
