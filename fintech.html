    <h2>Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</h2>
    <div class="image-section">
    <img src="capm.png" alt="PhD Work" class="custom-image">
    </div>
    <p>The diagram above represents the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). 
        In this model, the expected return on an investment is plotted against its beta, 
        which measures the investment's systematic risk relative to the market. 
        Key points in the diagram are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Risk-Free Rate:</strong> Indicated by the red dashed line, 
        this is the return on an investment with zero risk (typically a government bond yield). 
        In this example, it's set at 5%.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Return:</strong> Represented by the green dashed line, 
        this is the expected return of the market. It is calculated at a beta of 1, 
        which represents the market's own risk level.</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Return:</strong> This is calculated for 
        different values of beta (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 in this example). 
        As beta increases, indicating higher risk compared to the market, 
        the expected return also increases. 
        This line demonstrates the basic premise of CAPM: 
        higher risk (higher beta) is associated with higher expected returns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This diagram is a simple visualization of how CAPM quantifies the trade-off 
        between risk and return.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Book Value and Market Value</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Book Value:</strong> The book value of a company represents its net asset value, 
    calculated as total assets minus total liabilities. 
    This figure, often used in the valuation of companies, 
    reflects what would remain if the company were liquidated and its liabilities paid off. 
    It provides an estimate of the intrinsic value of a company based on its financial statements.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Market Value:</strong> The market value, often synonymous with market capitalization, 
    is the total value of a company's outstanding shares in the stock market. 
    This value reflects what investors are willing to pay for its stock, 
    influenced by factors such as company performance, investor sentiment, 
    and market trends. Unlike book value, market value is dictated by market perceptions 
    and future potential rather than just financial statements.
    </p>
    <p>
    The comparison between book value and market value is crucial in investment analysis, 
    as it can reveal insights into how the market perceives the worth of a company 
    compared to its financial valuation.

    <h2>Small Cap vs Large Cap Stocks</h2>
    <h3>Small Cap Stocks</h3>
    <p>
    <strong>Definition:</strong> Small cap stocks represent companies 
    with a market capitalization typically between $300 million and $2 billion. 
    These thresholds can vary across markets.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Characteristics:</strong> Small cap companies are often younger and more agile, 
    with significant potential for growth. 
    They can, however, exhibit higher volatility, reduced liquidity, 
    and greater sensitivity to market and economic fluctuations, 
    attributing to a higher risk profile.
    </p>

    <h3>Large Cap Stocks</h3>
    <p>
    <strong>Definition:</strong> Large cap stocks are those of companies with 
    market capitalizations generally exceeding $10 billion. 
    The exact threshold for what constitutes a large cap can vary.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Characteristics:</strong> Large cap companies are 
    typically well-established players in their industries, 
    known for their stable performance. 
    These stocks are often viewed as more secure investments 
    than their small cap counterparts, 
    with more diversified operations and access to capital.

    <h2>Comparing CAPM and Fama-French Models</h2>
    <h3>Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</h3>
    <p>
    <strong>CAPM Factors:</strong> The CAPM is a single-factor model focusing on market risk. 
    This risk is quantified using Beta (β), 
    which measures the sensitivity of an asset's returns to the returns of the overall market.
    </p>

    <h3>Fama-French Model</h3>
    <p>
    <strong>Market Risk Factor:</strong> Similar to CAPM, 
    the Fama-French model incorporates market risk as one of its factors.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>SMB (Small Minus Big):</strong> This factor represents 
    the additional return expected from investing in small-cap stocks compared to large-cap stocks.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>HML (High Minus Low):</strong> This factor accounts 
    for the additional return expected from investing in value stocks 
    (with high book-to-market ratios) versus growth stocks (with low book-to-market ratios).
    </p>
    <p>
    The Fama-French model, therefore, extends the CAPM by adding SMB and HML factors, 
    making it a three-factor model aimed at better explaining the variations in stock returns.
