            <h2>Adapting a Fusion Framework for the Stock Market</h2>
            <p>Joining a fusion startup, I embarked on a unique challenge: adapting a sophisticated feature engineering framework, originally developed for analyzing fusion experiments data, for the volatile world of stock trading. This task required not only a deep understanding of machine learning but also an innovative approach to translate complex physics concepts into the financial domain.</p>
            <p>My role was to bridge these two worlds, turning a tool that deciphered the complexities of fusion energy into one that could unravel the intricacies of market dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Developing the Greedy Algorithm: A New Approach to Stock Data</h2>
            <p>Central to this initiative was the development of a greedy algorithm tailored for stock market data. Leveraging temporal and phase derivatives as its search space, this algorithm was a pivotal step in transforming the framework into a robust tool for financial analysis. The goal was to capture subtle temporal patterns and intricate relationships within the stock market, offering predictive insights and strategic advantages.</p>
            <p>Key milestones of this project included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating a versatile algorithm that could adapt to the nuances of financial data.</li>
                <li>Utilizing advanced mathematical concepts to uncover hidden market trends.</li>
                <li>Ensuring the model's adaptability to real-time changes and evolving market conditions.</li>
            </ul>
