    <section id="greedy-algorithm-pde">
    <h2>Greedy Algorithm Project in Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>This project explores the use of a greedy algorithm for the construction of partial differential equations (PDEs) from empirical data. The algorithm iteratively adds terms to a PDE model, re-evaluating the coefficients with each addition, to balance model complexity with data fit. This method has applications in complex systems modeling, particularly in financial markets where underlying dynamics are often intricate and non-linear.</p>
    <p>Key aspects of the project include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Iterative addition of PDE terms based on data-driven insights.</li>
    <li>Re-evaluation of model coefficients with each term addition to optimize accuracy.</li>
    <li>Application of the model to real-world financial data for predictive analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Temporal and Phase Derivatives in PDE Construction</h2>
    <p>This project delves into the advanced application of temporal and phase derivatives for constructing partial differential equations from empirical data, aiming to capture the complex dynamics in physical and natural systems. This approach provides a nuanced understanding of time-dependent and spatial relationships in data.</p>
    <p>Key highlights of the project:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Use of temporal derivatives to understand time-dependent changes and dynamics in financial data.</li>
    <li>Incorporation of phase derivatives to explore spatial and phase-space relationships in market trends.</li>
    <li>Addressing challenges in data sampling and noise reduction for higher-order derivative estimation.</li>
    <li>Complex model selection process to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.</li>
