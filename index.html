    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> 
    Saumik is a U.S. permanent resident and an accomplished computational engineer 
    with a Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics from UT Austin. 
    He led the development of a fusion startup's first Python-based stock price predictor, 
    expanding their SaaS offerings to include financial analytics. 
    His work was instrumental in helping a surgical navigation startup 
    raise their largest series A fund. 
    His accomplishments in the lead up to a successful green card application 
    include groundbreaking large-grid geoscientific simulations on a supercomputer 
    using Fortran/C/MPI in graduate school, 
    and acceleration of Python-based simulations by few orders of magnitude at a national lab. 
    He is proficient in Bayesian inference, time series analysis, and machine learning.

    <!-- Project 1 -->
    <div class="portfolio-item">
    <h3 class="portfolio-title">Large Dataset Simulations</h3>
    <div class="portfolio-description">
    <p>My tenure at UT Austin, Los Alamos National Lab, and USC was marked by 
    extensive work in geoscientific simulations. Each project presented unique challenges, such as handling large datasets 
    and creating accurate simulation models. My contributions not only advanced the computational aspects of these projects 
    but also provided valuable insights into earth sciences, demonstrating the power of computational modeling in understanding and solving complex 
    problems. <a href="geoscientific.html">Read more</a></p>

    <!-- Project 2 -->
    <div class="portfolio-item">
    <h3 class="portfolio-title">Bayesian/MCMC for Time Series</h3>
    <div class="portfolio-description">
    <p>LANL was my first postdoc after finishing graduate school, and USC was my final postdoc
    before getting my green card. At USC, I spearheaded a project to develop 
    a Bayesian inference framework for model parameter estimation from time series data. 
    The challenge was to create a model that could accurately predict 
    and analyze complex data patterns. By employing Bayesian methods, 
    I was able to construct a framework that not only provided precise estimations 
    but also accounted for uncertainties in the data. <a href="bayesian.html">Read more</a></p>

    <!-- Project 3 -->
    <div class="portfolio-item">
    <h3 class="portfolio-title">Building a fusion startup's first stock price predictor</h3>
    <div class="portfolio-description">
    <p>Right after I got my green card, I joined a fusion startup, 
    and I was tasked with a challenging yet exhilarating project: 
    adapting a high-tech feature engineering framework, 
    initially designed for analyzing intricate fusion experiment data, 
    to the complex and unpredictable realm of stock market analysis. 
    This endeavor required a meticulous blend of physics, finance, 
    and advanced machine learning techniques. <a href="stock_prediction.html">Read more</a></p>
