            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Holding a Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics from UT Austin, 
                I specialize in computational modeling, data analysis, 
                and software development. 
                I have a distinctive flair for deciphering and 
                enhancing complex algorithms 
                that serve as the backbone for 
                diverse applications—from the intricacies 
                of geoscientific simulations to the predictive dynamics 
                of stock markets, and the precision of surgical navigation systems. 
                As a U.S. Permanent Resident, 
                I am dedicated to utilizing 
                my skills to address complex challenges and deliver significant impact.</p>

                <h3>Point Cloud Processing with PointNet</h3>
                <p>
                    I embarked on an ambitious project to leverage deep learning 
                    for point cloud processing. 
                    Utilizing the PointNet architecture, 
                    I developed a model capable of handling complex spatial data. 
                    This project was not only a technical challenge 
                    but also a venture into optimizing computational resources 
                    for real-time processing. 
                    The outcome was a robust model that significantly 
                    enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of our point cloud analysis, 
                    paving the way for more advanced applications in surgical navigation.

                <h3>Bayesian Inference for Time Series Data</h3>
                <p>
                    At USC, I spearheaded a project to develop a 
                    Bayesian inference framework for model parameter estimation 
                    from time series data. 
                    The challenge was to create a model 
                    that could accurately predict and analyze complex data patterns. 
                    By employing Bayesian methods, I was able to construct a 
                    framework that not only provided precise estimations 
                    but also accounted for uncertainties in the data.

                <h3>Geoscientific Simulations</h3>
                <p>
                    My tenure at UT Austin, Los Alamos National Lab, and USC 
                    was marked by extensive work in geoscientific simulations. 
                    These projects ranged from modeling subsurface flow to 
                    simulating geological formations. 
                    Each project presented unique challenges, 
                    such as handling large datasets 
                    and creating accurate simulation models. 
                    My contributions not only advanced the computational aspects 
                    of these projects but also provided valuable insights
                    into earth sciences, 
                    demonstrating the power of computational modeling 
                    in understanding and solving complex geoscientific problems.
