    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> 
    I am a U.S. permanent resident and an accomplished computational engineer 
    with a Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics from UT Austin. 
    In graduate school, I leveraged 
    a Fortran/C/MPI framework to enable groundbreaking 
    large-grid geoscientific simulations on a supercomputer. 
    At a national lab, I developed Python code 
    to accelerate subsurface flow simulations by 3 orders of magnitude. 
    I led the development of a fusion startup’s first Python-based stock price predictor, 
    expanding their SaaS offerings to include financial analytics. 
    I am proficient in Bayesian inference, time series analysis and machine learning.

    <p> 
    My tenure at UT Austin, Los Alamos National Lab, and USC was marked by 
    extensive work in geoscientific simulations. 
    Each project presented unique challenges, such as handling large datasets 
    and creating accurate simulation models. 
    My contributions not only advanced the computational aspects of these projects 
    but also provided valuable insights into earth sciences, 
    demonstrating the power of computational modeling in understanding and solving complex 
    problems.</p>
    
    <p>
    LANL was my first postdoc after finishing graduate school, and USC was my final postdoc
    before getting my green card. At USC, I spearheaded a project to develop 
    a Bayesian inference framework for model parameter estimation from time series data. 
    The challenge was to create a model that could accurately predict 
    and analyze complex data patterns. By employing Bayesian methods, 
    I was able to construct a framework that not only provided precise estimations 
    but also accounted for uncertainties in the data.</p> 

    <p>
    Right after I got my green card, I joined a fusion startup, 
    and I was tasked with a challenging yet exhilarating project: 
    adapting a high-tech feature engineering framework, 
    initially designed for analyzing intricate fusion experiment data, 
    to the complex and unpredictable realm of stock market analysis. 
    This endeavor required a meticulous blend of physics, finance, 
    and advanced machine learning techniques.</p>
