            I started in Fall 2012 at the Department of Engineering Mechanics, 
            on course to a classic Application Engineer working out at places like Abaqus, 
            and Ansys as a career path starting step post PhD. 
            The first problem I solved was a hydraulic fracturing code
            refactoring to stub out a cleaner way to understand how fractures 
            branch out under hydraulic 
            pressure inside the cracks. Along the way, I understood the impact 
            of algorithms and how the 
            underlying mathematics needs to be comprehended to genuinely make progress 
            in terms of making 
            things faster and accurate. In the Fall of 2014, 
            I switched to an advisor at the renowned Institute for Computational
            Engineering, right across the road from the Department of Engineering Mechanics, 
            and started
            tackling problems on the intersection of mechanics, high performance computing, 
            and algorithms. The crux of the PhD thesis was the solution of this problem.

            The idea being that the injection or production wells in the reservoir section 
            of the domain causes geomechanical reaction which have implications on the
            free surface, albeit on a different length scale. Prior to the implementation 
            of my algorithm, there was no way in-house for the code framework to pull off
            a simulation of such magnitude.
            With some sustained work in high performance computing, iterative solution techniques, 
            and coding in a mixed programming language environment, I was able to generate
            simulations of free surface displacements along side pressure evolution almost
            10000 feet beneath the free surface, at the same time.
