        I started in Fall 2012 at the Department of Engineering Mechanics, 
        on course to a classic Application Engineer working out at places like Abaqus, 
        and Ansys as a career path starting step post PhD. 
        The first problem I solved was a hydraulic fracturing code
        refactoring to stub out a cleaner way to understand how fractures 
        branch out under hydraulic 
        pressure inside the cracks. Along the way, I understood the impact 
        of algorithms and how the 
        underlying mathematics needs to be comprehended to genuinely make progress 
        in terms of making 
        things faster and accurate. In the Fall of 2014, 
        I switched to an advisor at the renowned Institute for Computational
        Engineering, right across the road from the Department of Engineering Mechanics, 
        and started
        tackling problems on the intersection of mechanics, high performance computing, 
        and algorithms. The crux of the PhD thesis was the solution of this problem
