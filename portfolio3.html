        My tenure at UT Austin, Los Alamos National Lab, and USC 
        was marked by extensive work in geoscientific simulations. 
        These projects ranged from modeling subsurface flow to 
        simulating geological formations. 
        Each project presented unique challenges, 
        such as handling large datasets 
        and creating accurate simulation models. 
        My contributions not only advanced the computational aspects 
        of these projects but also provided valuable insights
        into earth sciences, 
        demonstrating the power of computational modeling 
        in understanding and solving complex geoscientific problems.

        My natural inclination post PhD was to pursue a postdoc, to experience a national lab
        environment, and I went about working with a team of excellent scientists at LANL 
        on a graph based reduced order model to deliver fast yet accurate estimates of production 
        to rig operators in hydrocarbon projects.

        As I gradually started to realize that I shall be pursuing an industry career
        for a longer term, I published a paper, and moved on to an opportunity to work on
        an Army funded project at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in upstate NY.
