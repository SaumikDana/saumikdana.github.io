        My tenure at UT Austin, Los Alamos National Lab, and USC 
        was marked by extensive work in geoscientific simulations. 
        These projects ranged from modeling subsurface flow to 
        simulating geological formations. 
        Each project presented unique challenges, 
        such as handling large datasets 
        and creating accurate simulation models. 
        My contributions not only advanced the computational aspects 
        of these projects but also provided valuable insights
        into earth sciences, 
        demonstrating the power of computational modeling 
        in understanding and solving complex geoscientific problems.

        My natural inclination post PhD was to pursue a postdoc, to experience a national lab
        environment, and I went about working with a team of excellent scientists at LANL 
        on a graph based reduced order model to deliver fast yet accurate estimates of production 
        to rig operators in hydrocarbon projects.

        As I gradually started to realize that I shall be pursuing an industry career
        for a longer term, I published a paper, and moved on to an opportunity to work on
        an Army funded project at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in upstate NY. A funding issue 
        notwithstanding, I did get an interesting opportunity to work on a consulting project with 
        a startup in NYC during my time at RPI. Around that time, I also realized the impediment 
        of the visa process, which disallowed me from joining a company although we had excellent
        agreement of mutual value we bring to the table. I started taking steps to address the fact 
        that I would have to pursue my green card seriously, and I moved on to a bioinformatics
        gig at Baylor College of Medicine, with the sole purpose of publishing a paper with a 
        ton of citations. A month after starting at BCM, the United States shutdown in response 
        to the pandemic, and that hit me hard as I lost the opportunity to work with the colleagues
        at BCM on-site. A difficult period followed, and I was left with a simple choice of being
        very careful of the next position I choose, as this shall be the final one before I get 
        my green card. Such opportunity presented itself in the form of a postdoc at University of
        Southern California, and I primary job right off the gate was to add to the code framework
        the same algorithm that had presented itself with so much success during my PhD.
